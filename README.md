# Zigbee-of-Smart-Home
This is the curriculum design of my course called Zigbee design.
It has been used the Zigbee 's Z-stack to finish the simple function such as open the light , the fan and the alarm.

The model of Zigbee is CC2530,and I was use only four model to finish my curriculum design.
the first One is the role of coordinator,and it has no sensor on it.
and the others are the terminal,which are loaded with the sensors.such like 8bit LED,the machine,the temperature and humidity sensor,and the buzzer.

cause I am not very clear of Zigbee's Z-stack code,the change of my code are little clutter.But I could try my best to write the annotation.

Hope if you are the Zigbee lovers,and you see this code,you can give me a hand.
Or you need the same curriculum design just like me ,you can reference my code.
thank you very much!
